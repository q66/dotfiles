These are various configs that I use around the place (mostly on FreeBSD, will work on Linux and sometimes other OSes as well) that might be useful for other people. It currently includes:

- compton config (optimized for nvidia graphics with proprietary driver)
- mpv config (with vsync, interpolation, high quality scalers)

There might be other minor configs included. The list will also gradually expand over time.
