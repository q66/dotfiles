These are various configs that I use around the place (mostly on FreeBSD, will work on Linux and sometimes other OSes as well) that might be useful for other people. It currently includes:

- compton config (optimized for nvidia graphics with proprietary driver)
- mpv config (with vsync, interpolation, high quality scalers)

There might be other minor configs included. The list will also gradually expand over time. The confighs are gradually updated so make sure to pull once in a while (if you keep modifications, commit them and pull with rebase).
